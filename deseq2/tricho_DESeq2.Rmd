## Background

This document outlines the steps taken to analyze the RNASeq data using DESeq2 

## Load libraries

**1. Install (if required) & upload packages into your current session**

```{r install-packages, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
if(!require(dplyr)){install.packages("dplyr")} 
if(!require(tidyverse)){install.packages("tidyverse")} 
if(!require(ggpubr)){install.packages("plyr")}
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
```

**2. Upload the package into your current session**
```{r library, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse) 
library(dplyr) 
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## RNASeq Analysis with DESeq2

Remove duplicate KOs

```{r ddply, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Gene counts were assigned to Kegg IDs and the duplicate KOs in the dataset will be merged.
getwd()
# did some work in excel to rename columns, and find and replace blanks KOs with "NA"
df <- read.csv("keggassign_tricho_counts_fordedup.csv") 

df$gene_id <- ifelse(is.na(df$gene_id), df$Geneid, df$gene_id)
df = df[,2:20]

colnames(df)
summary(df) 
head(df)
dim(df) # there are 5258 entries

ddDF <- ddply(df,"gene_id",numcolwise(sum))
dim(ddDF) # now there are 4801 entries

write.csv(ddDF,"tricho_counts_deduped_forDESeq2.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Normalize data for subsequent analysis. After removing duplicates, the counts file will be trimmed to remove rows where the average of each treatment for a given gene is less than 5 (we keep genes where the average of at least one treatment is greater than 5). 

```{r trim, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# trimmed counts is the data where genes with low counts have been removed

trim_df <- read_csv("tricho_counts_deduped_forDESeq2.csv")
head(trim_df)
colnames(trim_df)
dim(trim_df)  # 4801 x 19

# calculate rowmeans
mean.L22 <- as.numeric(rowMeans(trim_df[, 2:4]))
mean.R22 <- as.numeric(rowMeans(trim_df[, 5:7]))
mean.L27 <- as.numeric(rowMeans(trim_df[, 8:10]))
mean.R27 <- as.numeric(rowMeans(trim_df[, 11:13]))
mean.L32 <- as.numeric(rowMeans(trim_df[, 14:16]))
mean.R32 <- as.numeric(rowMeans(trim_df[, 17:19]))

# create a dataframe only with rowmeans based on treatment
trim_df1 <- as.data.frame(cbind(mean.L22, mean.R22, mean.L27, mean.R27, mean.L32, mean.R32))
colnames(trim_df1)
summary(trim_df1)

trim_df2 <- cbind(trim_df$gene_id, trim_df1)
summary(trim_df2)
colnames(trim_df2)
names(trim_df2)[1] <- "gene_id"
head(trim_df2)
colnames(trim_df2)
summary(trim_df2)
dim(trim_df2) # 4801 x 7

# temp effort to check against manual effort
write.csv(trim_df2,file="manual_effort.csv")

# filter this rowMeans dataframe so that all rows where even one column is less than 5 is removed
# I think what's actually happening is that if ALL rows are <5, they're removed. Idk which one I really want 
trim_rows <- trim_df2 %>% dplyr::select(gene_id, starts_with("mean")) %>% filter_if(is.numeric, any_vars(. >= 5)) # should have 4088. Checked against a manual effort.

summary(trim_rows)
dim(trim_rows) # 4088 x 7

trimmed <- left_join(trim_rows, trim_df, by="gene_id")
head(trimmed)

final_trim <- trimmed %>% dplyr::select(gene_id, !(starts_with("mean")))
head(final_trim)
summary(final_trim)

write.csv(final_trim, file = "tricho_trimmed_forDESeq2.csv", row.names = TRUE)

```

Setting up the matrix for DESeq2 and generating normalized datasets.


```{r normalize, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

cts <- read_csv("tricho_trimmed_forDESeq2.csv")
colnames(cts);
cts <- cts[,3:20]
colnames(cts)

# column data is the metadata for the dataset
## the data has Sample, Treatment, Diel, and Design (combination of Treatment and Diel)
col <- read.csv("tricho_coldata_DESeq2.csv", header = TRUE)
head(col)

# set up DESeq2 matrix for Design
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = cts, colData = col, design = ~ Design)

# get normalized counts: not for DESeq but important for downstream visualization (DESeq2 input is non-normalized counts data because it undergoes normalization as a part of the pipeline). We will be using normalized counts for visualizations of biomarker genes.
# https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/lessons/02_DGE_count_normalization.html
# note that DESeq2 recommend vst transformed!!
ddsNorm <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
sizeFactors(ddsNorm)
normalized_counts <- counts(ddsNorm, normalized=TRUE)
write.csv(as.data.frame(normalized_counts), file="tricho_normcounts_forDGE.csv")

# plot a PCA to check the data 
vstcounts <- vst(dds, blind=FALSE)
write.csv((assay(vstcounts)), file="tricho_vstcounts_forDGE.csv")
head(assay(vstcounts), 3)
plotPCA(vstcounts, intgroup=c("Treatment", "Temp"))
ggsave("PCA_vstcounts.pdf", height=75, width=120, units='mm', dpi=500)
write.csv((assay(vstcounts)), file="tricho_vstcounts_forDGE.csv")
# I added the line of code above but idk if I actually need it 
rld <- rlog(dds, blind=FALSE)
plotPCA(rld, intgroup=c("Treatment", "Design"))
ggsave("PCA_rdl.pdf", height=75, width=120, units='mm', dpi=500)
write.csv((assay(rld)), file="tricho_rldcounts_forDGE.csv")

# don't use normalized counts (norm counts are used for comparison and other calculations)
